# Incorrect Segment Address Calculation in Assembly

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: incorrectly calculating segment addresses. The `bug.asm` file contains code that attempts to add an offset directly to a segment address, leading to incorrect memory access.  The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version.

This is a subtle but crucial error that can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities.  Understanding segment addressing is vital for writing robust assembly code.
